# Unmatched Stats v2 — Static project for GitHub Pages

This version adds:
- Full heroes list with ru/en names
- Maps list (many maps provided)
- Player profiles (add players, auto-aggregate stats, partners, favorite heroes)
- Dark select and option styling fixes
- Basic placeholder images (images/ folder)
- Support for entering multiple players (comma-separated) for 2v2 matches
- Saves data in localStorage so it's persistent per browser (or add server later)

How to deploy:
1. Create a public repo on GitHub.
2. Upload the files from this folder to the repository root.
3. Enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → source: main, folder: /root)
